# spotifyapi
This project scrapes music data and analyses it using the Spotify API

This is a research into the attributes related to popular independent music in India. For this, it's assumed that the most popular independent songs are available on the Spotify-curated Indian independent-music playlists. These attributes are described on the Spotify website. They are measured by Spotify itself and are provided upon an API request. The questions I’ve tackled are as follows:
1.	What are the most dominant features that are seen in the most popular Indian independent songs and how consistent are they?
2.	Correlation between the features.
3.	How have the durations and tempos of the songs changed over the years?
4.	What does the trend look like for Indian independent music in terms of all separate features from 2010-2021?

TOOLS USED:
1)	Spotify API to access music data
2)	Seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization
3)	Pandas and numpy for data analysis
